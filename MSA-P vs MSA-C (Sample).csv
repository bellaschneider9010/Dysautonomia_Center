She had hypertension at the time. She was an office manager at ASASP (a union of Prince George's county educational people, in Marlboro, MD), but she and other people noticed her handwriting was getting smaller and scribbly. After that when walking or getting up she would fall. Her blood pressure was going down to a very low level. She had a couple of auto accidents, and her husband stopped her from driving. She would pass out after getting out of the car. She was worse in the morning and better in the afternoon. She stopped work in September, 2012. Urinary retention has been a problem, and when her husband makes her laugh the urine comes. N catheterization has been necessary. She does have urinary tract infections, last about a month ago. Her husband evacuates her bowel every other day. She had a bedside commode but would faint when straining at stool. She doesn't sweat excessively. Drooling has developed over the last year. She had severe high blood pressure and went to a cardiologist. She was tried on levodopa by the first neurologist she saw at Johns Hopkins. This made the blood pressure problem worse. At Georgetown Dr. Lo wanted to raise the dose, but her husband feels this would lower the pressure more. There was not much effect of levodopa on the movement problem. Her food is liquefied, and it runs down her chest. Sometimes her husband has to open her eY for her. She has had two botox injections to try to help her camptocormia, but these haven't helped. She is on amlodipine, and she has a headache when her blood pressure is high, so this is when she gets an extra dose.
